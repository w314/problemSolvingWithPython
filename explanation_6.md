# Problem 6 - Max and Min in an Unsorted Array

### Time Complexity: `O(n)`
### Space Complexity: `O(1)`
### Algorithm Used: `for loop`

### Explanation

`Time complexity`: To find the minimum and maximum I traversed the input array once comparing each number to the minimum and maximum found so far. It resulted in time coplexity of `O(n)`. 

`Space complexity:` The method used needed just two extra variables to store the minimum and maximum values. It is not dependant on the size of the input array resulting in constant space complexity `O(1)`.
