# Problem 5 Explanation

### Time Complexity: `O(1)` for add_block() and `O(n)` for print block
### Space Complexity: `O(n)`
### Data Structure Used: `Linked List`

### Explanation

`Time complexity`: Using a linked list to store the blocks in the blockchain allows to add a block in constant time `O(1)`. To print the blockchain all the blocks have to be processed it takes linear time `O(n)`

`Space complexity:` Space needed depends on the size of the blockchain itself.
