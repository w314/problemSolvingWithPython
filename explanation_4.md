# Problem 4 - Dutch National Flag Problem

### Time Complexity: `O(n)`
### Space Complexity: `O(1)`
### Algorithm Used: `loops`

### Explanation

`Time complexity`: I have used a while loop to traverse the input_list, while keeping track the last indexes of '0's and '2's. This way had to traverse the list only once, with time complexity: `O(n)` .

`Space complexity:` I have rearranged the list in place resulting in a constant space complexity: `O(1)`.
