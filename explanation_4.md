# Problem 4

### Time Complexity: `O(n)`
### Space Complexity: `O(1)`
### Algorithm Used: `recursion`

### Explanation

`Time complexity`: In the worst case when looking for a non_existent user the algorithm has to go trough all users and subgroups once. Therefore time comlexity is linear `O(n)`, depends on the size of groups and users we search through.

`Space complexity:` There are no extra space requeirements.

I have used recursion as it made it possible for me to write a simple code. The task demanded to do the same subtasks (checking users and subgroups) again and again down the hieararchy. Recursion was a good fit for the task.
